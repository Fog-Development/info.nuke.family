# Product Context

## Problem

The Nuclear Family, a coalition of factions in the game Torn, needs a centralized and accessible information hub. Currently, vital information is scattered across various platforms, making it difficult for both internal members and external partners to find what they need. This leads to inefficiencies, miscommunication, and a fragmented understanding of the family's operations and services.

## Solution

This project provides a comprehensive Wiki that consolidates all relevant information about the Nuclear Family. The Wiki serves two primary audiences:

1.  **Internal Members:** Provides faction-specific information, guides, and operational procedures.
2.  **External Partners:** Offers clear, concise information about the services we offer, such as our reviving services, and how to do business with us.

## User Experience Goals

- **Clarity:** Information should be easy to find, read, and understand.
- **Accessibility:** The site must be easily navigable for all users, regardless of their technical skill level.
- **Reliability:** The information presented must be accurate and up-to-date.
