## Faction Rules

1.  **Participate in Contracts:** Active participation in all contracts, especially during Nuke/allied wars, is expected. We understand that smaller contracts fill up quickly, but full participation is required for major events.
2.  **Be Active Daily:** Log in multiple times a day to train, grow your crime experience (by doing crimes), and read faction mail. If you plan to be inactive for 2 or more days, please notify a leader.
3.  **Daily Energy Usage:** Spend a minimum of 500 energy daily on gym training and/or reviving. This includes revives outside of contracts. Your effort improves both your reputation and ours.
4.  **Financial Stability:** Members are expected to reside on a Private Island (PI) and maintain Donator Status within 30 days of joining. You can rent a PI and purchase Donator Status with in-game currency.
5.  **Chains & Ranked Wars:** Contribute at least 1% of hits during chains (e.g., 100 hits in a 10k chain). Use all available energy during ranked wars. Do not revive during ranked wars, as the revive perk is disabled.
6.  **Improve Nerve Bar:** Actively work on increasing your Natural Nerve Bar (NNB) by focusing on safe crimes.
7.  **Torn Stats:** Joining [Torn Stats](#important-links) is mandatory. It helps us track member progress, enforce rules, and manage competitions.
8.  **Organized Crime Policy:** Read and adhere to the [Organized Crime Policy](#organized-crime-oc-policy) detailed below.
9.  **No Scamming, Begging, or Drama:** We maintain a peaceful and respectful environment. Such behavior will not be tolerated.
10. **No Attacking Family:** Do not attack members of the Nuke family without prior arrangement. Exceptions may be made during Torn-wide events like Dog Tags or Elimination, with mutual consent. Mugging family members is strictly prohibited.
11. **Be Respectful:** Treat all members with honesty and respect.
12. **Protect Our Reputation:** Do not engage in conflicts that could tarnish Torn Medical's reputation.
13. **Real Life First:** We understand that real-life events can be unpredictable. If you need to be away unexpectedly, please inform leadership.
14. **Confidentiality:** Do not disclose the names of factions contracted with Torn Medical or Nuclear Central to anyone outside of NUKE.
15. **Racket Items:** Do not use items obtained from rackets (e.g., Erotic DVDs, Moonshine). These are used to fund the faction family.
16. **Have Fun!**

## Organized Crime (OC) Policy

### Importance of OCs

Organized Crimes (OCs) are crucial for our faction's growth. They contribute significantly to our respect gains, increase your crime experience, and generate income that funds faction-wide benefits.

### Joining and Initiating OCs

- **Eligibility:** After ~100 days in the faction, you will lose the "Resident" title and gain the ability to initiate and plan your own OCs.
- **Initiation:** You can initiate an OC from the "Crimes" tab in the faction panel when its status is "Ready." Ensure all participants are available (not traveling, jailed, or hospitalized).
- **Re-planning:** After a successful OC, re-plan it with the same participants. If someone is missing, notify an OC manager, Committee member, or Leadership.
- **Misuse of Privilege:** Abusing OC permissions will result in their removal and may lead to fines or dismissal from the faction.

### OC Cancellation

Canceling an OC without prior permission from OC managers, Committee, or Leadership is strictly prohibited and will result in a minimum fine of 10 points.

### OC Delay Policy

Delays hurt the faction's progress. Fines will be issued for delays caused by:

- Traveling when an OC is due.
- Overdosing on drugs and not setting revive permissions to "Allow everyone."
- Being hospitalized from a failed crime and not getting out.

**Exceptions:** If you are delayed by an action taken against you (e.g., arrested, overseas mug), send a copy of the event log to Leadership to be exempt from fines. No fines will be issued during Torn-wide events that require travel or hospitalization.

### OC Delay Fines

Fines are issued on a tiered system. If you go 30 days without a delay, your penalty tier will be reduced.

| Types of delay    | 1st penalty | 2nd penalty | 3rd penalty | 4+ penalty |
| :---------------- | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :--------: |
| **Blackmail**     |  10 Points  |  10 Points  |  10 Points  | 15 Points  |
| **Kidnapping**    |  10 Points  |  10 Points  |  15 Points  | 20 Points  |
| **Bomb Threat**   |  10 Points  |  15 Points  |  20 Points  | 30 Points  |
| **All Other OCs** |  10 Points  |  20 Points  |  55 Points  | 110 Points |

Fines must be paid to the faction vault within 7 days.
