# Discord Bot (Foggy Bot)

## Introduction

Foggy Bot is a Discord bot that interacts with the Torn API and the Nuke Family site. The bot can be used to create new revive contracts, check the status of existing contracts, and more. The bot is currently in development and new features are being added regularly.

## Requesting a Revive Contract

If you're a client looking to request a revive contract, you can create a new ticket on our [Nuclear Central Discord server](https://discord.gg/ukq9gC4mHS). The bot will automatically create a new revive contract for you, based on the information you provide it. It will also provide you with a link to track the live status of your contract. An example of this in action can be seen below:

<ReactPlayer controls url={ExampleVideoUrl} />
