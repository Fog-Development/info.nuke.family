# Requirements

- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome or Firefox) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox)
- You must be a member of the Nuke Family and registered on the [Nuke Family website](https://nuke.family/)
- You must have a [Nuke Family API key](https://nuke.family/auth/token-generation). The userscript will assist you in generating a Nuke Family site API key and saving it in the script.

  :::caution
  The script does not currently support TornPDA. Some people have had limited success trying to use it with TornPDA, but it is not officially supported. I intend to add support for TornPDA in the future.
