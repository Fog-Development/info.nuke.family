# Usage

After installing the script you will be able to see blacklisted members and add your own.

## Verifying Installation

You can verify the installation is working by visiting a players profile, you should see a `Nuke Family Shitlist` box. If you do not see this box, please refer to the [Troubleshooting](./installation#troubleshooting) section. The box can look a few different ways:

<details>
	<summary>Box Examples</summary>

    **Nuke Family Member**\

    **Blacklisted Person (Both player and faction blacklist reasons)**\

    **Not Blacklisted**\
    ![nuke family shitlist box not blacklisted](nuke_blacklist_not_blacklisted.png)

</details>

## Adding a Blacklist Entry

Click the "Add to Shitlist" button on a players profile to add them to the blacklist. You will be prompted to select a category and enter a reason (see image below).

Once you submit the entry, it will be added to the blacklist and submitted for approval. Blacklist entries that still require approval will still appear on the blacklist, but will be marked as pending approval and will appear slightly different. This allows members to see submissions right away that may be time sensitive, but still highlight that they are pending approval and may not be verified yet.

### Blacklist Categories

The following categories are available for at the individual player level:

- **Buy Mugger** - Someone who has attempted to mug you after buying an item. We try and reserve this for the most egregious cases.
- **Revive No-Payment** - Someone who has not paid for a revive. Please try and resolve this with the player first and give them around 24 hours to pay before adding them.
- **Absolute Scum Lord** - Someone who has done something so egregious that they deserve to be on the blacklist. This is a catch-all category for anything that doesn't fit the other categories.
- **Other** - If you have a reason that doesn't fit the other categories, you can use this one.

The following categories are available at the faction level:

- **Enemy Alliance** - Someone who is in an enemy alliance.
- **Nuke Family** - This is a special category that appears as a "friendly ban". This will automatically show on any player who is currently in a Nuke Family faction and is designed to allow members to see who is in the family.

## Removing a Blacklist Entry

Unfortunately, the script does not currently support removing blacklist entries. This is a feature that will be added in the future. If you need to remove a blacklist entry, please reach out to me (Fogest) on Discord and I can assist you with this.
