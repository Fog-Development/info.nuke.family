# Nuke Blacklist Userscript

The Nuclear Shitlist (_aka Nuclear Blacklist_) allows you to add people to a blacklist under various categories and reasons. Any users added to the blacklist are submitted for approval and will be reviewed by staff. This helps ensure that the blacklist is not abused and that users are not added for invalid reasons. In future versions of the script, you will be able to pick and choose which categories you care about. If you don't care to see blacklisted buymuggers, no problem, you'll be able to disable that category.
