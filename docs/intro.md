# Introduction to the Nuke Family

Welcome to the official documentation for our website and bot that interact with both the [Torn API](https://torn.com) and the [Nuke Family site](https://nuke.family). This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to help you understand and utilize our product effectively. Whether you are a client looking to integrate our services into your projects or a staff member seeking instructions on how to perform specific tasks, this documentation has got you covered.

## How to Use Our Services

There are multiple services we offer to clients, the main one being our reviving services. You can checkout our [reviving page](./reviving/) for more information on how to use this service. We also offer a [bot](reviving/revive-bot) that can be used to interact with the Torn API and our website. The bot can currently be used to create new revive contracts. Nuke members and staff also have some additional functionality.

## Discord

We have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ukq9gC4mHS) where you can create tickets, ask questions, get help, and chat with other users.
