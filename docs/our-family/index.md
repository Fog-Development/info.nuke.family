# Our Family

The Nuclear Family is made up of a set of **9** factions that work together to grow as players. Each faction has its own unique set of rules and requirements, but all factions share a common goal of growth. We have [**4 training factions**](#training-factions) focused on gym training and ranked warring. We have [**4 reviving factions**](#revive-focused-factions) with slightly differing requirements and focuses. And finally we have one focused heavily on PA's and is the top dog when it comes to everything [**crime related**](#crime-focused-faction).
