# Reviving Contracts

## Introduction

Typically clients start between around 50-60% success chance and above, with the option to change the limit as and when needed. Contracts can be either "auto" on Green light/Online members, or Request Only. Our Nuclear reviving family consists of [Torn Medical](https://www.torn.com/factions.php?step=profile&ID=17133#/), [Emergency Room](https://www.torn.com/factions.php?step=profile&ID=9745#/), [Nuclear Clinic](https://www.torn.com/factions.php?step=profile&ID=21028#/), and [Nuclear Therapy](https://www.torn.com/factions.php?step=profile&ID=13851#/).

### What we need to know from you

We need some essential details to confirm the contract for you, please let us know the answer to the following questions. If you create a ticket, our bot will walk you through these questions.

1.  **Premium** or **Standard** contract?
2.  By request only? Or "auto" revive contract (we will revive any person of online, idle, or offline status without needing a request)
3.  What is the cap we should revive people down to? Clients often start with 50% revive chance, but this is up to you and can be adjusted during a contract by contacting a staff member!
4.  Any hostile contract needed (usually used in wars) ? If so we usually set it to a standard revive contract with 50% auto revives on offliners. If you want different than this, let us know
5.  When should the contract begin? If it's for a ranked war we usually just assume it's at the start of your war so this isn't needed unless it differs from that.

### How to Request Revives

Request revives can be made in 4 different ways. Via the scripts we offer for the first 3 options. Clients can also can use the nurse bot in their Discord server to have revives forwarded to our Nuclear Central discord server without having to get members to join our separate server.

The script options are listed below:

If you'd like members to be able to request revives using a `!r` or `!revive` in your own Discord server you will need to use the linked provided below to add the bot to your Discord server. You will need to be a server admin on your own Discord server in order to add a bot to it. And a server admin on the Nuclear Central Discord will also need to remove your server from quarantine prior to the revive requests working properly from your server.

URL to add bot: [https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=617318575056879636&permissions=75840&scope=bot](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=617318575056879636&permissions=75840&scope=bot)

:::tip title="Note"
When requesting revives you can use the command `!pr` to specifically request a **premium revive**. If you do not use this command, you will not be quarenteed a premium revive.
