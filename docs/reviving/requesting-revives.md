# How to Request Revives

Request revives can be made in 4 different ways. Via the scripts we offer for the first 3 options. Clients can also can use the nurse bot in their Discord server to have revives forwarded to our Nuclear Central discord server without having to get members to join our separate server.

The script options are listed below:

If you'd like members to be able to request revives using a `!r` or `!revive` in your own Discord server you will need to use the linked provided below to add the bot to your Discord server. You will need to be a server admin on your own Discord server in order to add a bot to it. And a server admin on the Nuclear Central Discord will also need to remove your server from quarantine prior to the revive requests working properly from your server.

URL to add bot: [https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=617318575056879636&permissions=75840&scope=bot](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=617318575056879636&permissions=75840&scope=bot)

:::tip[Note]
When requesting revives you can use the command `!pr` to specifically request a **premium revive**. If you do not use this command, you will not be quarenteed a premium revive.
