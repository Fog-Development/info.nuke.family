# How to Request Revives

Revives can be requested from us in 5 different ways, each with their own benefits and drawbacks.

## Nuclear Central Hospital Discord

Before requesting revives using any of the methods below, we recommend joining our [Nuclear Central Hospital Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ukq9gC4mHS). This server is where we handle all revive requests and communicate with our users. By joining the server, you can stay updated on any changes to our services, get support if you encounter any issues, and connect with other users who utilize our reviving services.

Within the server you can directly request revives using the Nuke Assistant bot if you prefer to do so directly in our server. If you plan to have your faction using our server we recommend adding the Nuke Assistant bot to your own server as described in the [Nuke Assistant Discord Bot](#nuke-assistant-discord-bot) section below.

## Nuke ReviveMe Userscript

The [Nuke ReviveMe userscript](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=67&t=16183433&b=0&a=0) is a script that can be installed in your browser to help you request revives. It is a simple script that adds a button to the top of the hospital page which allows you to request a revive from the Nuclear Family. This script is only available for the browser version of Torn. If you are already using TornPDA (mobile) or TornTools with your browser, you do not need to use this script as those two options already have revive requesting for our faction family built in.

## Torn PDA

The [Torn PDA](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=67&t=16163503&b=0&a=0) is a mobile application for Android and iOS. Just like [Torn Tools](#torn-tools) this application has a revive request feature built in.

You'll want to make sure that you have your TornPDA settings set to use the "Nuke Reviving Services". You'll find such a section in the settings of the app to change reviving providers. Typically by default you are already on our services unless you changed this. Images of how to change this setting can be found below in the spoiler.

When you are in the hospital you will see a "Request Revive" button on your main Torn PDA dashboard. When you click this it will send us a revive request.

## Torn Tools

The [Torn Tools](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=67&t=16243863) browser extension has revive requesting built-in just like [Torn PDA](#torn-pda). This works similar to how TornPDA works in that you'll need to change your settings to make sure our services are selected. When you're in the hospital you'll have a button you can press to request a revive. This request will get forwarded to us. If you have any contract in progress revivers will be made aware one is active when this request is made.

## Nuke Assistant Discord Bot

The [Nuke Assistant Discord Bot](./nuke-assistant-revive-bot.md) is a bot that can be added to your server. It has a couple commands currently that can be used. The purpose of it is to replace the old Nuclear Nurse bot that made use of old `!` style commands. This new bot makes use of the new Discord "[Slash Commands](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ)". Please check out the [Nuke Assistant Revive Bot](./nuke-assistant-revive-bot.md) page for more information on how to add it to your server.

:::caution[Old Nuclear Nurse Bot]
In early 2024 we switched to a new Discord bot. If you are still using the old bot, we suggest you switch to our new Discord bot. To switch to the new bot you can simply follow the instructions on the [Nuke Assistant Revive Bot](./nuke-assistant-revive-bot) page to add it to your server. If you already have a bot named the "Nuke Assistant" you are already using the latest bot!
