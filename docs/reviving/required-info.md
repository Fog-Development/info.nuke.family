# What we need to know from you

We need some essential details to confirm the contract for you, please let us know the answer to the following questions. If you create a ticket, our bot will walk you through these questions.

1.  **Premium** or **Standard** contract?
2.  By request only? Or "auto" revive contract (we will revive any person of online, idle, or offline status without needing a request)
3.  What is the cap we should revive people down to? Clients often start with 50% revive chance, but this is up to you and can be adjusted during a contract by contacting a staff member!
4.  Any hostile contract needed (usually used in wars) ? If so we usually set it to a standard revive contract with 50% auto revives on offliners. If you want different than this, let us know
5.  When should the contract begin? If it's for a ranked war we usually just assume it's at the start of your war so this isn't needed unless it differs from that.
