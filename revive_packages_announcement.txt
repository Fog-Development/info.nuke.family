REVIVE PACKAGES ANNOUNCEMENT
=============================

🎁 New Feature: Revive Packages Now Live!


Message:
--------
We're excited to announce the launch of **Revive Packages** - a new pre-paid revive system that makes it easier for clients to get revived and for you to get paid faster!

This new feature has soft launched and will be officially launched to clients soon after a brief testing period. Here's everything you need to know:

## What Are Revive Packages?

Clients can now purchase pre-paid bundles of premium Level 100 revives:
- **25 Revives** - 45m
- **50 Revives** - 90m
- **100 Revives** - 180m

## How It Works for Revivers

When you revive a client who has an active package:
- **Automatic deduction** - Their package balance is automatically decremented, their revive request will indicate it is a pre-paid package revive. Do not ask for payment!
- **No chasing non-payers** - No need to chase payments, we will get you paid out like a regular bill would
- **Premium rates** - All package revives are Level 100 revives, unless the client does not choose to have premium revives

## How Clients Use It

1. Click the **Revive Package Manager** button on any revive request embed or in their DM
2. Select a package size (25, 50, or 100 revives)
3. Follow payment instructions provided
4. Payment is automatically detected within 5 minutes
5. Their revives are credited and ready to use

## Key Features

✅ **Auto-payment detection** - Payments are tracked automatically using unique codes
✅ **Top-up system** - Clients can add more revives when running low
✅ **Live tracking** - Clients get a tracking URL to monitor their balance
✅ **Embedded balance** - Current package status shown in the Package Manager

## What This Means for You

- **Paid for Success AND Failure** - Typically you only get paid for successful revives, but with packages, you get paid for every revive attempt made using a package
- **Better client experience** - Clients can pre-pay and forget about it
- **Paid like a bill** - You get paid out regularly without needing to chase payments
- **Increased retention** - Easier for clients to commit to multiple revives upfront

If you notice any issues or have questions about the new system, please reach out!
